The error you are encountering is because Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is not installed on your system. Pystan, a dependency of fbprophet, requires a C++ compiler to build its extensions.

To resolve this issue, you need to install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools:

Go to the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools download page: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
Click on the "Download" button.
Run the downloaded installer (vs_BuildTools.exe).
In the installer, select the "C++ build tools" workload checkbox and make sure the "MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools" and "Windows 10 SDK" components are checked. You can uncheck other components if you don't need them.
Click on the "Install" button and wait for the installation to complete.
After you have successfully installed Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools, you should be able to install Pystan and other required packages without any issues.
